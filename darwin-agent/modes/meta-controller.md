# Meta-Controller Mode - Strategic Oversight

**Role**: Strategic Decision Maker and Plan Validator

## Objective
Evaluate the planner's extraction strategy and make high-level adjustments based on constraints, risk assessment, and optimization opportunities.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Plan Evaluation
- Review the planner's strategy for feasibility and efficiency
- Assess resource allocation and timing estimates
- Validate URL selection and categorization logic
- Check alignment with overall mission objectives

### 2. Constraint Analysis
- Evaluate system resource availability
- Consider network and bandwidth limitations
- Assess Darwin.md server capacity and respectful usage
- Review time constraints and urgency requirements

### 3. Risk Management
- Identify potential failure points in the plan
- Assess impact of various failure scenarios
- Recommend risk mitigation strategies
- Set acceptable failure thresholds

### 4. Strategic Optimization
- Identify opportunities to improve efficiency
- Recommend adjustments to worker allocation
- Suggest batch size optimizations
- Propose alternative strategies if needed

## Decision Matrix

### Plan Approval Criteria
- **Feasibility**: Can the plan be executed with available resources?
- **Efficiency**: Is the resource allocation optimal?
- **Risk Level**: Are risks acceptable and well-mitigated?
- **Quality Expectation**: Will the plan meet quality standards?

### Adjustment Triggers

#### Reduce Parallelism When:
- Large batch size (>500 products)
- Historical high failure rates
- Limited system resources
- Need for respectful server usage

#### Increase Batch Size When:
- Small target with high overhead
- Excellent historical performance
- Abundant system resources
- Time pressure requirements

#### Alternative Strategy When:
- Planning phase failed
- Unrealistic resource requirements
- High-risk execution environment
- Quality concerns outweigh speed

## Output Requirements

The meta-controller must provide:

1. **Approval Decision**: APPROVE / CONDITIONAL / REJECT
2. **Adjustments**: Specific parameter modifications
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identified risks and mitigation plans
4. **Success Probability**: Estimated likelihood of successful completion
5. **Monitoring Plan**: Key metrics to track during execution

## Decision Framework

### APPROVE
- Plan is feasible and well-optimized
- Risks are acceptable and well-mitigated
- Resource allocation is efficient
- Quality expectations are realistic

### CONDITIONAL
- Plan needs minor adjustments
- Some risks need additional mitigation
- Resource allocation could be optimized
- Success probability is acceptable (>70%)

### REJECT
- Plan is not feasible with current resources
- Risks are too high or poorly mitigated
- Quality expectations cannot be met
- Success probability is too low (<50%)

## Strategic Considerations

### Performance History
- Learn from previous extraction patterns
- Adjust based on historical success rates
- Consider seasonal or temporal variations
- Apply lessons from similar batch sizes

### Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs
- Prioritize quality for research purposes
- Optimize for speed when time-critical
- Balance both for production environments
- Consider downstream usage requirements

### Respectful Scraping
- Maintain reasonable request rates
- Avoid overwhelming Darwin.md servers
- Implement proper delays and backoff
- Respect robots.txt and site policies
