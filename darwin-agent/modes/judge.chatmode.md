## Quality Evaluation Framework

### Scoring Methodology (0-10 Scale)

**1. Completeness Score (0-10):**
```markdown
**Required Fields Assessment:**
- Name: Present and non-empty (2 points)
- Price: Valid MDL format (2 points)  
- Category: Matches Darwin.md taxonomy (2 points)
- URL: Valid source link (1 point)

**Optional Fields Assessment:**
- Description: Present and meaningful (1 point)
- Image URL: Accessible and valid (1 point)
- Brand: Extracted and accurate (1 point)

**Scoring Logic:**
- 10: All required + all optional fields present
- 8-9: All required + most optional fields
- 6-7: All required + some optional fields
- 4-5: Most required fields present
- 0-3: Missing critical required fields
```

**2. Accuracy Score (0-10):**
```markdown
**Format Validation:**
- Price: Correct MDL format (3 points)
- Category: Valid Darwin.md category (2 points)
- URL: Proper Darwin.md structure (2 points)

**Content Quality:**
- Name: Accurate product identification (2 points)
- Description: Relevant and coherent (1 point)

**Scoring Logic:**
- 10: Perfect format compliance and content accuracy
- 8-9: Minor format issues, excellent content
- 6-7: Some format issues, good content quality
- 4-5: Multiple format issues, acceptable content
- 0-3: Major format violations, poor content quality
```

**3. Structure Score (0-10):**
```markdown
**Data Consistency:**
- Field types match expected formats (3 points)
- Character encoding proper (UTF-8) (2 points)
- No formatting artifacts or HTML remnants (2 points)

**Schema Compliance:**
- All expected fields present in structure (2 points)
- Proper JSON/data structure format (1 point)

**Scoring Logic:**
- 10: Perfect structure and formatting
- 8-9: Minor structural inconsistencies
- 6-7: Some structural issues, generally compliant
- 4-5: Multiple structural problems
- 0-3: Major structural violations
```

### Overall Quality Calculation

**Quality Score Formula:**
```
overall_score = (completeness * 0.4) + (accuracy * 0.35) + (structure * 0.25)
```

**Threshold Rules:**
- `overall_score >= 8.0` → **EXCELLENT** (approved for production use)
- `overall_score >= 7.0` → **GOOD** (approved with minor notes)
- `overall_score >= 5.0` → **NEEDS_REVISION** (requires improvements)
- `overall_score < 5.0` → **FAILED** (significant issues, re-extraction recommended)

**Critical Failure Conditions:**
- Missing more than 50% of required fields → Automatic FAILED
- Price format completely invalid → Automatic FAILED  
- Category not in Darwin.md taxonomy → Automatic NEEDS_REVISION
- All image URLs inaccessible → Quality degradation (-1.0 from overall)
